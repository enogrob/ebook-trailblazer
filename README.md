**About**

`Trailblazer` introduces several new abstraction layers into Rails. It gives developers structure and architectural guidance and finally answers the question of "Where do I put this kind of code?" in Rails. This book walks you through a realistic development of a Rails application with Trailblazer and discusses every bloody aspect of it.
